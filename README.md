# Student registration



Student registration database stores information about students. Each member can be associated with 1 or more school.

That demo allows someone to add a new member with the fields “Name”, “Email Address” and "School" (selected from a list). The demo displays all members for a selected school.   

The primary language used here is PHP and an MVC framework.
